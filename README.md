# User_Directory Professional README

View a live demo of the app at https://ryansswell.github.io/User_Directory/

## Description

React User Directory:
I created this app in design for users to be able to select or search for a specific user within this directory. This could be applied to a company so managers, human resources or anybody can view and sort between users. The data fields can be customized to help with user data.

This was a fun assignment I had during my coding bootcamp.

## Usage

Provided is an example of creating a user directory within your company or any directory that has a search function to find specific individuals!

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

npm start

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
